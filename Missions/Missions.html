               </section>
               <section>
                 <p>The computer industry has been considered as the top of ten national high-tech industries that are strongly empowered by the government. By the year 2002, the computer and information industry generates more than 10% of the overall revenue produced by the manufacturing industries in Taiwan, which is also accountable for over 35% of the total earnings produced by the ten national high-tech industries. This indicates that the computer and information industry plays an essential role in the future economic development of the country. Thus, educating students with professional knowledge and engineering discipline in advanced information technology becomes crucial for supporting the economy growth of the country.</p>

                 <p>(2) Commitment in meeting the growing needs of society</p>
               </section>
               <section>
                 <p>Currently, the growing computer industry needs a great number of professionals specialized in information technology. However, the number of information engineering students produced by universities is unable to satisfy such a demand. According to the surveys conducted by official and by private organizations, the number of students in computer science related majors is extremely incapable to meet the current demand and the future growth of computer industry. The establishment of our department can help to relieve the shortage of information technology professionals and benefit the future growth of computer industry.</p>

               </section>
               <section>
                 <p>The department is located in the Kuang-Hwa business district where various electronic equipments and computer hardware/software providers have clustered. This gives possibilities for the department to engage student activities with those providers within the district so as to provide students more opportunities to gain practical experiences in the workplace. Furthermore, the location of the department is very close to the national software science-based industrial park in Nan-Kang, Taipei. This highly benefits the joint developments between the department and the high-tech companies in the industrial park. With the opportunities provided by the location, the department strives for embracing local businesses, industry, and the professions to raise the level of science and technology, and for achieving the objectives of the university - conduct outstanding research and develop practical and cutting-edge technology to promote the growth of businesses and industry.</p>

               </section>
               <section>
                 <p>In the system of university of technology, only a few universities have offered the computer science and information engineering program. This is quite different from those general universities where the program has been set up by most of the universities. Thus, the establishment of our department can strongly support the development of professional education of the country and provide a great opportunity to junior college graduates to obtain the broad knowledge of computer science and to learn the advanced information technology.</p>

               </section>
               <section>
                 <p>According to the long-term strategic plan of our university, a college of electrical and information engineering is anticipated to be founded in the future. The establishment of our department can significantly facilitate the long-term development of the university. In addition, the department is expected to offer a broad array courses open to students in other majors. This provides students a great chance to learn about the state-of-the-art information technology. The students can further take computer science to be their minor specialty so as to increase their ability for professional competence.</p>
